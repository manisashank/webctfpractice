Here's a ciphertext that was generated by the script:

   bWN/XXVDRVRDUmVJQkNVcU9STn5JVFVnVENIAVJwQ1RfdUNFVENSWw==

Now, to break it, you have to do three things.  First, figure out how
to reverse the encryption, when you know the secret key (the
character).  Second, try decoding with all possible secret keys
(characters).  Third, analyze those results to see which one looks
most like English ASCII text.  Here you need to do use some facts
about what ASCII letters in English look like.

Finally, a note about b64encode (and b64decode).  Base64 is a way to
take arbitrary bytes and represent them only with letters, numbers,
and a few simple punctuation symbols---this avoids printing garbage
characters.  You'll have to undo this process when solving the
challenge.

Happy Hacking!
